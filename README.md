# pico_stuff
Small projects written using the SDK for the Raspberry Pi Pico.

1. pi_biquad: An implementation of the biquad filter test to test sampling rate to test performance on the Raspberry Pi Pico. Supports the two cores.
2. pi_shasha20: Implementations of the SHA256 hashing algorithm and the ChaCha20 stream cipher to test performance on the Raspberry Pi Pico. Supports the two cores.
3. picoremark: A porting of the popular CoreMark benchmark to the Pi Pico's multicore architecture. Stripped of a lot of comments, but usable in the current state.
